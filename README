Hi! To run the hands-on session of the SimpleElastix workshop at the OpenMR Benelux 2020,
there are a couple of requirements that should be installed previous to the start of the session:

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3
- PyTorch 1.3
- SimpleElastix - Python binding
- Nibabel
- H5py
- Scipy

If you are having any problems installing any of the packages, especially SimpleElastix, 
which have some known issues with MacOS, please contact me via our Slack channel, or DM me there,
I will be happy to give you some support!
